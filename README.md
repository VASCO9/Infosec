RISK MANAGEMENT

Identifying the Risk: 	Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.
Analyze the Risk 	Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.
Evaluate the Risk: 	Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).
Dealing with Risk: 	Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.
Monitoring Risk: 	All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, i.e., from low to medium or high impact.

Cherrytree 	Visual Studio Code 	Evernote
Notion 	GitBook 	Sublime Text
Notepad++

Some of these are more focused on note-taking, while others such as Notion and GitBook have richer features that can be used to create Wiki-type pages, cheat sheets, and more. It is important to make sure that any client data is only stored locally and not synced to the cloud if using one of these tools on real-world assessments.

Tip: Learning Markdown language is easy and very useful for note taking, as it can be easily represented in a visually appealing and organized way.

Number 	Category 	Description
1. 	Broken Access Control 	Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc.
2. 	Cryptographic Failures 	Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.
3. 	Injection 	User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc.
4. 	Insecure Design 	These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind.
5. 	Security Misconfiguration 	Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information.
6. 	Vulnerable and Outdated Components 	Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.
7. 	Identification and Authentication Failures 	Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management.
8. 	Software and Data Integrity Failures 	Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs).
9. 	Security Logging and Monitoring Failures 	This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected..
10. 	Server-Side Request Forgery 	SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).

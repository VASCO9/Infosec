Evaluate the Risk: 	Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).
Dealing with Risk: 	Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.
Monitoring Risk: 	All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, i.e., from low to medium or high impact.

Some of these are more focused on note-taking, while others such as Notion and GitBook have richer features that can be used to create Wiki-type pages, cheat sheets, and more. It is important to make sure that any client data is only stored locally and not synced to the cloud if using one of these tools on real-world assessments.

Tip: Learning Markdown language is easy and very useful for note taking, as it can be easily represented in a visually appealing and organized way.
